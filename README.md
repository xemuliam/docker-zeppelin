Created from Zeppelin [base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/xemuliam/zeppelin-base) to minimize traffic and deployment time in case of changes should be applied on top of Zeppelin.

## Why base image is required?

DockerHub does not cache image layers while compilation. Thus creation of base image (with pure Zeppelin) mitigates this issue and let us to experiment/play with Zeppelin settings w/o downloading full Zeppelin archive (more than 500MB) each time when we change smth. in configuration (or libs, add-ons, etc.) and recompile docker image. Only our changes will be pulled out from Docker Hub instead of full image.

# Overview

Dockerized single-host Zeppelin.  
- Amended and recompiled __*JDBC interpreter*__ (since 0.8 following bug has been fixed and fix is already included in standard distribution) has been added to avoid full scan of database schemas and columns on interpreter initialization (there is SQL-completer which scans all described stuff. If your database contains tons of columns and tens schemas it will take several hours to initialize JDBC interpreter. Now this scan is switched off)
- __*Groovy*__ added as interpreter for Groovy lovers (since 0.8 it is community-supported interpreter)
- __*Python*__ backend (since 0.8 it is Python3) has been added (from 0.7.3 *Python* backend has been extended by __*NumPy, SciPy, Pandas*__ and __*MatPlotLib*__)

Deployment options out of the box:
- Standalone Zeppelin node


## Exposed ports

- 8080 - Zeppelin web application port
- 8443 - Zeppelin web application secure port


## Volumes

All below volumes can be mounted to docker host machine folders or shared folders to easy maintain data inside them. 

Zeppelin-specific:
- /opt/zeppelin/logs
- /opt/zeppelin/notebook


## Additional environment properties

To add more flexibility in configuration there are some environment variables have been added to the image.  

- HOMESCREEN - Display note IDs (e.g. 2A94M5J1Z) on the Apache Zeppelin homescreen instead of standard Zeppelin homepage
- HOMESCREEN_HIDE - Hide the note ID set by HOMESCREEN on the Apache Zeppelin homescreen.

For the further information, please read [Customize your Zeppelin homepage](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0/manual/notebookashomepage.html)

__*Please keep in mind that above properties are content-dependent. Thus at first you should map your Notebook volume to container-independent storage and only then set above properties*__

# Usage

This image can either be used as a base image for building on top of NiFi or just to experiment with. I personally have not attempted to use this in a production use case.

Please use corresponding branches from this repo to play with code.


## Pre-Requisites
Ensure the following pre-requisites are met (due to some blocker bugs in earlier versions). As of today, the latest Docker Toolbox and Homebrew are fine.

- Docker 1.10+
- Docker Machine 0.6.0+
- Kitematic 0.12

(all downloadable as a single [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) package as well)


## How to use from Kitematic

1. Start Kitematic
2. Enter `xemuliam` in serach box
3. Choose `zeppelin` image
4. Click `Create` button

Kitematic will assign all ports and you'll be able to run NiFi web-interface directly from Kitematic.


## How to use from Docker CLI

1. Start Docker Quickstart Terminal
2. Run command  `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 xemuliam/zeppelin`
3. Check Docker machine IP  `docker-machine ls`
4. Use IP from previous step in address bar of your favorite browser, e.g. ` http://192.168.99.100:8080/#/`

# Enjoy! :)
